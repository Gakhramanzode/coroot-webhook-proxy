# Coroot Webhook Proxy

This app receives webhooks from Coroot.
It receives JSON data. It checks the status and message. Then it sends message to VK Teams.

## How it works

1. Coroot sends a POST-response.
2. The app reads the JSON.
3. It creates a text message.
4. It sends the message to VK Teams.

## How to run

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t coroot-webhook-proxy .
```
2. Run in Kubernetes. Use Deployment, Service, Ingress.
3. Set environment variables:
`VK_URL` - API VK Teams URL
`VK_CHAT_ID` - Chat ID
`VK_TOKEN` - Access token

## Example
Example JSON from Coroot:
```json
{
  "status": "Deployed",
  "application": "default:Deployment:app1",
  "version": "123ab456: app:v1.8.2",
  "summary": [
    "ðŸ’” Availability: 87% (objective: 99%)",
    "ðŸ’” CPU usage: +21% (+$37/mo) compared to the previous deployment",
    "ðŸŽ‰ Memory: looks like the memory leak has been fixed"
  ],
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/p/x0xwl4jz/app/default:Deployment:app1/Deployments#123ab456:123"
}
```
Example message for VK Teams:
```
Deployed: city-gateway-01:Deployment:city-gateway
- ðŸ’” Latency: 93.37% of requests faster 500ms (objective: 99%)
- ðŸŽ‰ CPU usage: -7% compared to the previous deployment
- ðŸ’” Memory usage: +6% compared to the previous deployment
- ðŸ’” Logs: the number of errors in the logs has increased by 336%
